# Googly Eyes Description

## Overview

This package contains a googly-eye attachment for SuperDex Robotics. The SolidWorks CAD geometry and all derived digital assets in this directory are the original work of Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates. No third-party digital model or geometry was used.

## Derivations

The following work was done to produce the simulation-ready asset:

- Authored the source CAD geometry in `cad/`.
- Generated the GLB render meshes in `render/` from the CAD geometry.
- Used SuperDex Studio to import the CAD geometry, refine the derived meshes, and generate the HDF5 collision models in `collision/`; `intermediates/` records the Studio processing configuration.
- Assembled `googly_eyes.superdex_bot` from the render and collision assets.
